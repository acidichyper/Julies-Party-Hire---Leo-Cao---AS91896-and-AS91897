My GUI Idea
My idea is to make the user be able to append multiple items under the same name. I will do this by creating a cart system where the user has to input their full name and afterwards, they are able to append multiple items into a cart which is under the same name. We can then append thee cart which will print out all the data  which shows the customers items and all their items they hired all under the same name. The deleting function will work by creating a new GUI which will ask the user for the customers receipt number. Inputting the receipt number will show all the items they hired, and the user will  be able to delete individual items from their name.
